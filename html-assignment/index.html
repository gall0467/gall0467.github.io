            <h2>About Me.</h2>
            <p>
                Hey there! If you found this website, then you’re interested in knowing a little bit about me. Well, I am a 20 year old college student living in Ottawa. I was born on June 27<sup>th</sup> in Montreal. I spent the early years of my life there, and then I moved to Vaughan, Ontario where I spent most of my life. Vaughan is a city in the <abbr title="Greater Toronto Area">GTA</abbr>. It’s close to <em>Canada’s Wonderland</em>, and I spent several summers having fun there.

                I moved to Ottawa with my Mom after we established it was too expensive to live in Vaughan. Ottawa was a really good opportunity for me to finally start focusing on my academic career, and leave behind the partying and distractions. It definitely took longer than it should have for me to embrace the opportunity and actually start focusing on school, but I found my way eventually.

                Here is a quote that resonated with me, and really helps me get through rough patches on my journey.
